## Awards

Through its parent organization, [ADHO](http://adho.org), ACH sponsors several major awards at the annual Digital Humanities conference, on behalf of all the digital humanities organizations. The [Busa Prize](http://adho.org/awards/roberto-busa-prize), named in honor of Father Roberto Busa is awarded for lifetime/career achievement and the [Zampolli Prize](http://adho.org/awards/antonio-zampolli-prize), in honor of Antonio Zampolli, recognizes a singular project or accomplishment. The Paul Fortier prize will be awarded to the best young scholar paper of the conference.


## Bursaries

Bursaries are usually available to a subset of ACH members attending the ACH conference; please see a given year's conference site or email conference@ach.org for details.

ADHO Bursaries (which your ACH membership fees support) are available to enable the attendance of students and younger scholars at the annual DH conference. Bursary applications are on the [ADHO website](http://adho.org/awards/conference-bursary-awards).
