## Awards

Through its parent organization, [ADHO](http://adho.org), ACH sponsors several major awards at the annual Digital Humanities conference, on behalf of all the digital humanities organizations. The [Busa Prize](http://adho.org/awards/roberto-busa-prize), named in honor of Father Roberto Busa is awarded for lifetime/career achievement and the [Zampolli Prize](http://adho.org/awards/antonio-zampolli-prize), in honor of Antonio Zampolli, recognizes a singular project or accomplishment. The Paul Fortier prize will be awarded to the best young scholar paper of the conference.


## Bursaries

ADHO Bursaries (which your ACH membership fees support) are available to enable the attendance of students and younger scholars at the annual DH conference. Bursary applications are on the [ADHO website](http://adho.org/awards/conference-bursary-awards).

See a list of past [ACH Bursary award recipients](/news/2011/06/bursary-recipients/).


## Grants

ACH periodically offers small grants in support of DH meetings, small project development, and other DH-related activities. Occasional requests are evaluated [according to established guidelines](/activities/grants-and-awards/occasional-funding-sponsorship/). Standing programs, such as Incubator Grants are announced on Humanist and in the ACH newsletter (sent to all ACH members via email).

For 2017-2018, occasional funding and grants are no longer being accepted. Resumption of occasional funding will be made via our twitter account.
