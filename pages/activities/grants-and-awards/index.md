## Awards

Through its parent organization, [ADHO](http://adho.org), ACH sponsors several major awards at the annual Digital Humanities conference, on behalf of all the digital humanities organizations. The [Busa Prize](http://adho.org/awards/roberto-busa-prize), named in honor of Father Roberto Busa is awarded for lifetime/career achievement and the [Zampolli Prize](http://adho.org/awards/antonio-zampolli-prize), in honor of Antonio Zampolli, recognizes a singular project or accomplishment. The Paul Fortier prize will be awarded to the best young scholar paper of the conference.

## ACH Start-Your Project Funds Award

The Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) Start-Your-Project award is specifically designed to support small digital projects at various stages of development. The primary goal of these awards is to provide critical support to individuals who might otherwise face barriers in initiating digital scholarship projects due to constraints such as limited financial resources and time commitments within their existing roles. We are particularly enthusiastic about supporting those who aspire to make a meaningful impact but require the necessary support to embark on their work. 

This initiative is designed to be inclusive, recognizing the diverse backgrounds and circumstances of our potential applicants. These awards aim to help transform ideas into tangible projects.
