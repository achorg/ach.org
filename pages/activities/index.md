ACH is a community-driven organization, supported by your membership fees. Our most important activities center on cultivating and strengthening the field of digital humanities, and providing guidance and support to those entering the field. Our goal is to create a more diverse, cohesive, and vibrant community for digital humanists, and to help advance digital humanities research and practice. To this end we sponsor a range of outreach activities. These include mentoring programs, welcoming events at the annual DH conference, DH-related sessions at other conferences, grants to young scholars, and open-access publication of DH research.


## Advocacy

As a professional association for the digital humanities, ACH performs an important advocacy role. We develop and share position papers on issues of importance to our members, partner with other organizations to advocate for key positions, and support initiatives (such as 4Humanities) that help track and intervene in the central political debates that affect our work.

## Jobs and Mentoring

Looking for a digital humanities job? Our volunteer mentors can help you find and prepare for it! Have a vacant position and want to fill it with a talented digital humanist? Our events and communications are a fantastic venue for meeting digital humanities practitioners on the market.

Throughout the year, and most especially at our annual DH conferences, the ACH provides support, guidance, and publicity services for employers and job-seekers. We also wish to encourage reflection and analysis about work and careers within the humanities computing community, and do this by sponsoring conference sessions and workshops.

We offer the following services to job seekers:

- An ongoing mentoring program of events throughout the year — see our [Mentoring page](/activities/mentoring/) for more info.
- The annual ACH Jobs Slam, held at the DH conference at the ACH Annual General Meeting. The jobs slam is an opportunity for job seekers and those hiring to announce themselves and make contact.


## Grants and Awards

The ACH supports young scholars by providing bursaries to defray costs of attending conferences and other DH events. ACH also participates in the ADHO achievement awards which recognize achievements in the field of Digital Humanities. [\[More information\]](/activities/grants-and-awards)


## Open Agenda-Setting

Beginning in 2012, the Association for Computers and the Humanities moved toward more open and transparent agenda-setting. We look to you to help us better serve the international digital humanities community—by generating new ideas for our Executive Council to explore, and prioritizing items already on our agenda.
