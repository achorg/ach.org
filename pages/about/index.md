The Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) is the US-based professional society for the digital humanities. We support and disseminate research and cultivate a vibrant professional community through conferences, publications, and outreach activities.

We welcome members of any academic affiliation or professional role who are interested in the digital humanities and who would like to help shape the values and priorities of our organization, which are centered on the needs and interests of US-based DH practitioners. For practitioners in other parts of the world, we encourage you to [explore the constituent organizations of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Oorganizations (ADHO)](https://www.adho.org) to find the one that's the best fit for you.

Through its publications, conferences, workshops, outreach, training opportunities, and other mentoring activities, ACH aims to offer assistance to members at all levels of experience. Its support of open-access publications and open-source tools are part of its mission to increase access to scholarly work in the digital humanities and in the academy more broadly.
