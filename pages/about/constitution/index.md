Approved August 1979, Amended 1983, 1987, 1992, 2002, 2013, 2021


### I. Membership and Dues


#### A. The Membership of the Association shall consist of

1. Members. Any person may become a Member of the Association on the terms established by the Association and published on its website and in the categories of membership provided.
2. Honorary Members. Honorary Membership may be conferred on any person, for life, upon the recommendation of the Executive Council. Such Honorary Members shall enjoy all the rights and privileges of a regular member in the Association.


#### B. Privileges of Membership

1. Each Member in good standing in the Association shall receive, as part of the privileges of membership, a subscription to any publications of the Association, unless their chosen membership option states otherwise.
2. All classes of membership, except as otherwise specified, shall be entitled to reduced prices on such publications as the Association may arrange, to reduced registration fees at the annual meeting, and to other benefits as may be negotiated or provided by the Executive Council.


#### C. Payment of Dues

2. Honorary Members shall not be required to pay annual dues.


#### D. Removal and Resignation of Members

1. The privileges of the Association shall be withdrawn from any member whose annual dues are six months overdue.
2. Any member may withdraw from the Association by notifying the Executive Secretariat. No refund of dues will be made.


### II. Elections

1. At each annual meeting of the Executive Council it shall appoint a Nominating Committee consisting of an Executive Officer and four other members, who shall be current members of the ACH but need not be members of the Executive Council. Each year nominations will be made for Executive Council vacancies; every other year nominations will be made for President(s) and Vice President(s)/President(s)-Elect (unless otherwise needed by a vacancy).
2. At some time before 1 February the Nominating Committee shall transmit to the Executive Secretariat nominations of at least double the number of positions that shall become vacant on the Executive Council and/or for the Executive Officers at the next election, based on an email or Web nomination process managed by the Nominating Committee. This process should allow for self-nomination as well as nomination by another member of the Association, and should gather pertinent information about the candidate’s interests and background for inclusion on the ballot. The Nominating Committee shall ensure diversity in the candidate pool, and that all nominated candidates who willing to serve are included on the ballot. The Nominating Committee shall further ensure that all candidates on the ballot are ACH members in good standing or are willing to become such prior to the distribution of the election ballot.
3. After receiving the list of nominations from the Nominating Committee, the Executive Secretariat shall distribute to each voting member a ballot listing all persons nominated to run in the election. Ballots may be distributed and collected electronically (by fax, email, Web, or other means) provided there is a mechanism for preserving the secrecy of the ballot while still ensuring that each member casts only one vote. The ballot must indicate the number of seats that are to be filled ( and therefore the maximum number of persons for whom members may vote). The ballot must also include the address to which it must be returned (unless it is to be submitted interactively, for example through a Web form), and the date by which it must be received in order to be counted. All ballots received by the specified deadline shall be opened and tallied by the Executive Secretariat, and certified by the President(s) and Vice President(s)/President(s)-Elect. The results will be transmitted to the Executive Council, Officers, and all candidates for office; any of those people may request a formal recount before the next Executive Council meeting. Results of the election will be announced to the Members on or about 15 March. The Executive Secretariat will keep the records of voting, including physical or electronic ballots until the completion of the first meeting of the Executive Council after the election.


### III. Vacancies

1. In the event of the resignation of any elected member of the Executive Council, save in the last year of their term, the resulting vacancy shall be filled by electing one additional member at the normal annual election for the Executive Council. The member who receives the fewest votes of those elected on that occasion shall serve only during the residual term of the resigned member. This procedure shall also be adopted, mutatis mutandis, in the case of multiple vacancies.
2. If the position of Immediate Past President(s) becomes vacant for any reason, it shall not be filled until the President(s) can assume this position.
3. If the position of President(s) becomes vacant, the Vice President(s) shall assume the office and responsibilities of the President(s). Following the expiration of the original term, the new President(s) shall stay on for another full term as originally intended.
4. If the position of Vice President(s) becomes vacant, an interim Vice President(s) shall be elected by the Executive Council from among its ranks. At the next election cycle, one or more new Vice President(s) shall be elected.
5. The President(s) and Vice President(s) are charged with organizing the process to appoint or re-appoint other officers of the organization (with final approval by the Executive Council).
6. Any officer in the organization who does not remain a member in good standing may be removed by vote of the Executive Council.


### IV. Standing Committees

The Executive Council shall establish standing committees, appoint their members and chairpersons by vote, and accept their reports. The membership of these standing committees will be composed of Executive Council members and/or ACH members in good standing. Standing committees will be expected to submit regular reports at intervals established by the Executive Council. These committees shall include:

1. A Committee on Advocacy and Outreach, normally chaired by an ACH Vice President.
2. A Nominating Committee, as described in section IIA of the Bylaws, above.


### V. Special Interest Groups

Members shall be encouraged to form Special Interest Groups. With the approval of the Executive Council, they may hold sessions during the annual meeting, distribute newsletters, apply for occasional funding support through established mechanisms, and in other ways further their particular concerns within the general framework of the Association.


### VI. Council Representatives from Related Professional Associations

The Council may approve having an official liaison to any related learned society or professional association. ACH and the related association would agree upon a person named to be the liaison who would be a member of both organizations to serve as long as both organizations deem it appropriate. The role of the liaison is to encourage a broad exchange of information and to promote exchange sessions and panels at regular meetings of the related association.


### VII. Affiliated Chapters

The Association encourages the formation of regional or thematic chapters, and is willing to negotiate cooperative agreements and mutually beneficial dues structures. A potential ACH chapter may apply to the Executive Council for start-up costs, and may also apply for more formal ties, to be specified in mutually-agreeable terms. In either case, the ACH chapter will determine its own governance structure and budget. The Council may dissolve its sponsorship for such an organization at any time, so long as it gives six months’ notice in writing to the leadership of that organization.


### VIII. Fiscal Year

The fiscal year of the Association shall be the calendar year.


### IX. Rules of Order

In all matters not determined by the Constitution or the Bylaws, the proceedings for the Association shall be governed by the latest edition of <cite>Roberts’ Rules of Order</cite>.
