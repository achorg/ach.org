Founded in 1978, the ACH dates back to a period when the landscape of computing, and its relation to the humanities, looked very different from that of today. In the more than three decades since, developments in both technology and in the ways humanists understand and use technology have fundamentally transformed both domains. As the major US professional association for computing humanists, the ACH has provided a forum for the research, discussions, and technical explorations that have fueled this transformation. It has also grown from a small community into a much more substantial association; the annual Digital Humanities conference (now sponsored by ADHO, ACH's parent organization) now attracts about 400 attendees and continues to grow.

A full history of the ACH would draw both on public records and on the human memory of those who have been involved, many of whom are recognized in the lists below. We are in the process of compiling versions of that history, and we welcome contributions from anyone with recollections or relevant documents to offer.
