The results of the ACH elections are in!

Anna Kijas, Zoe LeBlanc, and Rebecca Sutton-Koeser were elected to serve in the Executive Council for the 2019-2023 term. Their terms will start at the close of the annual summer Executive Council meeting, which will take place at the [ACH 2019 conference](http://ach2019.ach.org/) in Pittsburgh, PA.

As always, many thanks to all of the candidates. It is because of our members willingness to serve that ACH continues to flourish.
