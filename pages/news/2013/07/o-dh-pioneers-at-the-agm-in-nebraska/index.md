Thanks to all of the contributors to our Pedagogy Lightning Talks at the ACH AGM at [DH2013](http://dh2013.unl.edu/). A tremendous wealth of creativity and experience was shared in a short 15 minutes, and the slides will very shortly be posted on this site.

In the meantime, though, here is the wonderfully witty poem that provided a wonderful capstone to the lightning presentations.

> <p>Some people believe in the “new new new thing”<br />
> That we know as DH — but I’d like to bring</p>
>
> <p>Something older and wiser to the next generation:<br />
> DH history, tradition, respect, veneration.</p>
>
> <p>Willa Cather, whose homeland is hosting, my dears,<br />
> Has inspired my title: O DH Pioneers!</p>
>
> <p>I tell DH students of Busa and Bush<br />
> (that’s Roberto and Vannevar — not George Dubya, whoosh!)</p>
>
> <p>I like them to know Michael Sperberg-McQueen,<br />
> And then claim XML as his DH machine.</p>
>
> <p>I also proclaim, from my own institution,<br />
> A somewhat less famous DH contribution:</p>
>
> <p>My very own colleague, Elijah R. Meeks,<br />
> Who gave Wikipedia its first DH tweaks.</p>
>
> <p>But something is missing: No need to be prudish:<br />
> These DH pioneers are all whitish, and dudish!</p>
>
> <p>DH women and people of color — we’ve got ’em!<br />
> I’d like to suggest that it’s time that we taught ’em.</p>
>
> <p>To enhance our rich history with something less cursory:<br />
> Not only more History, but also more Herstory.</p>
