The annual Digital Humanities conference is an opportunity for the ACH to pursue in-person many of the initiatives that we support more virtually during the year. We hope you’ll be able to join us for some or all of our events at [DH2013 in Nebraska](http://dh2013.unl.edu/)! See our full listing of activities, including a jobs slam, pedagogy lightning talks, mentorship mixer, newcomers’ dinners, and more!
