Like [many in the global DH community](http://www.allc.org/about/people/memorials/lisa-lena-opas-h%C3%A4nninens-memorial), members of the ACH Executive Council were saddened to learn of the death of our friend Lisa Lena Opas-Hänninen, chair of [ALLC](http://www.allc.org/), the European Association for Digital Humanities.  

Lisa Lena was a steadfast mentor to junior scholars, a keen supporter of cross-cultural collaboration, and a warm and intelligent [participant in worldwide DH conversations](http://www.jadh.org/obituary) over the past two decades. We [join our ADHO colleagues](http://adho.org/announcements/2013/obituary-prof-lisa-lena-opas-h%C3%A4nninen-chair-allc-european-association-digital) in gratitude for her contributions and sorrow at her passing.
