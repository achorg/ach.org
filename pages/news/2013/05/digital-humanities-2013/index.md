The annual Digital Humanities conference is an opportunity for the ACH to pursue in-person many of the initiatives that we support more virtually during the year. We hope you’ll be able to join us for some or all of our events at [DH2013 in Nebraska](http://dh2013.unl.edu/)!

## ACH Annual General Meeting, Jobs Slam, and Pedagogy Lightning Talks

Sure, there may be some sub-committee reports and even an important vote or two, but you haven’t really experienced an annual general meeting until you’ve been to an ACH Jobs Slam! This is a lively event where prospective employees and employers have 30 seconds of floor-time to woo each other. If you’d like to participate, please see our [ACH 2013 Jobs Slam page](/news/2013/05/jobs-slam-2013) for more information.

Also planned for this year’s AGM is an open program of informal lightning talks on DH pedagogy. Do you have a quick story about a student project or training model to share? Want to tell us how you organized your syllabus or make a pitch for a new way of thinking about DH education? See [our post on lightning talks](/news/2013/05/lightning-talks-dh2013) for details and to sign up!

The ACH AGM will be held in the Nebraska Student Union from noon-1:30pm on Wednesday, July 17th. Join us for a free, healthy, vegetarian-friendly lunch!

We also hope to enhance remote participation to this year’s AGM, beyond just the backchannel communication that we’ve had in past years. Internet gods and hotel conference wifi willing, we will find a way to broadcast the proceedings and enable remote participation. We will update this space with more details as we’re able.

## ACH Newcomers Dinner

Is this your first or second time at the Digital Humanities conference? Are you new to the DH community? Join a small group of newbies and ACH old-timers at a local restaurant, to make scholarly connections and new friendships.

Dinners will happen the evening of Wednesday, 17 July, with parties departing from the lobby of the conference hotel at the times indicated. For ease of conversation, groups are limited to six people. Long-term ACH members and other DH conference veterans are heartily encouraged to volunteer!

## ACH Mentorship Mixer

This is a very casual outing where all current participants in the ACH Mentoring program are invited to a local pub or bar to chat with one another. The first round of refreshments is offered by the ACH. This year’s edition will take place at the [Starlite Lounge](http://www.buzzardbillys.com/lincoln/the-starlite-lounge/), Thursday July 18th at 7pm (247 N 8th St, Suite 101, Lincoln NE 68508).

## Please Ask, Do Tell!

After a hiatus of a couple of years the "Please Ask! Do Tell!" stickers will be back with a vengeance, complete with a new design. Don’t be shy, ask and tell!

Someone with this sticker may have some advice to offer or know about an interesting DH job – please feel free to ask them!

Someone with this sticker is looking for professional advice and/or job opportunities, so if you have something to offer, please let them know! Pick up your sticker(s) at the ACH display near the DH 2013 registration tables!
