**Due October 31st, 2013.**

The Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) invites nominations for the 2013/2014 elections, in which our members will elect a President and Vice President for two-year terms, as well as three Executive Council members for four-year terms. We seek candidates who want to advance the field of digital humanities (DH) by helping to run the ACH.

ACH officers and Executive Council members develop and uphold ACH policies, determine and distribute funding, and oversee all organizational activities. Activities for 2013/2014 include our mentorship program and jobs slams, advocacy work, publications including Digital Humanities Quarterly and DH Answers, collaborations with ADHO partners in the annual DH conference and other initiatives, co-administration of a number of prestigious DH awards, distribution of student bursaries for DH training and education, as well as other priorities as set by ACH. You could be involved in helping ACH programs succeed by nominating yourself, or someone else, to be an active participant in the leadership of the Association.

To be confirmed as an ACH officer or Executive Council member, candidates must be [members in good standing of the ACH](https://members.ach.org/). They commit to attending annual council meetings at the Digital Humanities conference and participate in discussions during the rest of the year by email and audio/video conference. Council members are expected to be active in the digital humanities community. We welcome participants not just from universities and colleges but also galleries, libraries, museums, community organizations, and other organizations engaged with digital humanities. Independent scholars, graduate students, alternative academics, women, those of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds, and other under-represented communities are especially encouraged to self-nominate, or to be nominated by the membership. Demonstrated commitment to the organization and to the field counts for more with our membership than professional affiliations or academic status/titles.

Send nominations to [nominations@ach.org](mailto:nominations@ach.org) by October 31st, 2013. Please confirm with your nominee that he or she is willing to serve, and:

- Put one of the following in the subject line, as appropriate: 
  - Executive Council nomination
  - ACH President nomination
  - ACH Vice President nomination
- Provide a brief candidate statement and biography. Sample candidate statements from [past elections](/news/2011/12/elections-candidates/) are available. If your nominee cannot provide their bio and candidate statement at the time of nomination, they should email those to us before the close of nominations.
- All nominations require two nominations (a self-nomination counts as one nomination) to be considered for the ballot (per ACH bylaws), so please allow time for a second nominee to email in support of your nomination.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us at [nominations@ach.org](mailto:nominations@ach.org).

The three top vote-getters in the Executive Council race will be elected to four-year terms. For more information on the responsibilities and obligations of ACH council members, see [our Bylaws](/about/constitution). Current officers of the ACH are listed on [our officers page](/about/officers).
