If you’re a graduate student who’s considering attending next year’s [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](http://www.dhsi.org/) (and if you hadn’t considered it, you should!), ACH is offering several bursaries graduate student members to help defray costs for travel and lodging. Any ACH graduate student member is eligible for our bursaries.

Additionally, DHSI is offering ten tuition scholarships to members of the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](http://adho.org) (ADHO) and its constituent organizations. You can find more details about the bursaries and scholarships on the [DHSI Scholarships](http://dhsi.org/scholarships.php) page.
