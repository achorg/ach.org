*[LLC: The Journal of Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/)* will publish a special issue of top papers from [Digital Humanities 2013](http://dh2013.unl.edu/), the annual conference of the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](http://adho.org), held this summer at the University of Nebraska. We invite submissions from anyone who presented at the meeting, including those who gave long and short papers, or who participated in panels and poster sessions.

Long articles of up to 6,000 words in length (notes &amp; bibliography excluded) should take up theoretical issues in digital humanities or report on completed work, including at least preliminary evaluation of its results. While there is more room in shorter articles for description of work at earlier stages, we emphasize that short papers of no more than 2,000 words should make scholarly points and not merely report on DH project activities. All submissions will be evaluated by at least two independent referees.

Submissions must be received by midnight CET on November 15th 2013.

Interested authors should:

1. Contact Bethany Nowviskie ([bethany@virginia.edu](mailto:bethany@virginia.edu)) as soon as possible to inform the editors of an intention to submit.  
2. Prepare manuscripts using the [LLC guidelines](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/litlin/for_authors/)  
3. Submit manuscripts directly to the [LLC submission site](http://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/llc) by November 15th. Please make clear in your submission that it is for the ‘DH2013 issue’, and see the [instructions for online submission](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/litlin/for_authors/online_submission.html).

We emphasize that it is the author’s responsibility to see that LLC’s formal guidelines are met. All content from this special issue will be released as open access by Oxford Journals for a period of three months after publication. Authors retain their copyright, may make pre-prints available without restriction, and may share post-prints after a 24-month embargo. Proceeds from LLC are the primary means of support for the ADHO organizations (EADH, ACH, CSDH-SCHN, aaDH, JDH, and centerNet) and their various open-access journals and publications.

Guest editors for this special issue are Bethany Nowviskie (University of Virginia) and Melissa Terras (University College London), respectively chair and vice-chair of the 2013 program committee, and Katherine L. Walter (University of Nebraska), local host of the conference.
