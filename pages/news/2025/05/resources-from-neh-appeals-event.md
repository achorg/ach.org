The Association for Computers and the Humanities, American Historical Association, and Modern Language Association hosted an Information Exchange about the NEH Appeal Process. Below is a summary of the conversation and resources. ACH, AHA, and MLA are not providing legal advice. Below represents aggregated information from all who attended the event.

Consider filing an appeal. An appeal to terminated grants demonstrates the importance of humanities grants as well as following processes outlined by the NEH. Appeals must be made within 30 days and submitted through eGMS: [https://reach.neh.gov/Login](https://reach.neh.gov/Login).

Review your specific contract for appeal details. All grant documents should be in eGMS, including grant agreements.

Composing an appeal. The MLA has been aggregating Appeal Strategies [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHGciRYjETxum-4JPpMyRfb7yJJQJOKxTyVyiD24anE/edit?tab=t.0). There is also additional information about NEH processes [here](https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-awards-organizations-grants-and-cooperative-agreements-issued-january-2022#_Toc92721723) (for organization grants) and [here](https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-awards-individuals) (for individual grants). A document with aggregated appeal language from participants is [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V-MbG1_xOlvmHT-NYC0ssGPhpcUEdYlGcVXGOQTSHA8/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.sfwfip4ntng1) (Please email us with your appeal language if you are willing to share.)

Increase impact. To increase the impact of the appeal, consider sending a copy of the appeal to your congressional representatives: [https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member](https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member)

**Frequently Asked Questions:**

* *How do I know if my grant was canceled?*
    * There has been confusion due to the notices coming through email accounts such as Grant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com.  One way to find out is to log into eGMS. Another is to check [impact.ach.org](https://impact.ach.org) which is keeping an up-to-date list of terminated grants.
* *How do you know if you have an individual or institutional award?*
    * Usually, an award for a fellowship or summer stipend is an individual grant. If awarded to your institution and you’re the PI, it may be an organizational award. One can determine by going into the [NEH Award Search](https://apps.neh.gov/publicquery/) and it will indicate which type. Another way is to [log into eGMS](https://reach.neh.gov/Login) and look at the grant agreement.
* *Where should I submit my appeal?*
    * To follow the NEH’s outlined appeal process, it must go through eGMS. Other participants recommended also emailing the following accounts: chairsoffice@neh.gov, grantmanagement@neh.gov, mmcdonald@neh.gov, and/or gencounsel@neh.gov
    * See screenshot below for Messages tab in eGMS Reach. Click on New Message to send your appeal. Note that you can add an Attachment. You can address to the “Senior Deputy Chairman, National Endowment for the Humanities” in the body of the message and/or in an attached letter.

They are digital humanists, historians, literature scholars, and humanists. And, they have been committed to the humanities and the public good.
