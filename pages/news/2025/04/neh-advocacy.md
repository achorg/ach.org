ACH continues its advocacy work in response to DOGEâ€™s cancellation of the vast majority of digital humanities and other grants awarded by the National Endowment of the Humanities. Our next two events:

Wednesday, April 9th at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET, join us for an action-oriented workshop to contact your elected officials to advocate for the NEH and IMLS. We will provide links, talking points, messages, and scripts, including resources from colleagues such as the National Humanities Alliance. [Register here.](https://members.ach.org/civicrm/event/info/?id=34)

Friday, April 11 at 9:30 AM PT / 12:30 PM ET, join us for a rapid-response workshop, designed to give you the tools you need to write and pitch an op-ed. All are welcome. [Register here.](https://members.ach.org/civicrm/event/info/?id=33)

When contacting your representatives or writing op-eds, you may want to reference the NEH grants that have been canceled. ACH has compiled data from numerous sources to develop a [database of NEH grants](https://impact.ach.org/) that we understand have received cancellation notices from DOGE. The database continues to be under development as we receive more information.
