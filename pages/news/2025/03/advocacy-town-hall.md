Join us for one or both ACH Town Halls to discuss recent events affecting Digital Humanities. They are designed to hear your experiences regarding how the recent government actions are affecting your ability to pursue digital humanities, and the steps that ACH can take to support you and your communities.  

* Wednesday, March 19th from noon to 1pm ET. [Register here.](https://members.ach.org/civicrm/event/info/?reset=1&id=31) 
* Friday, Friday March 21st from noon to 1pm ET. [Register here.](https://members.ach.org/civicrm/event/info/?id=32&reset=1)

**Guiding Questions:**
* How has government interference affected your ability to conduct research, engage in scholarship and praxis, or work with community partners?
* Are (and how are) changes on the federal, state, and institutional levels affecting your place of work or engagement?
* What responses are possible, knowing these responses are dependent on positionality, precarity, and placement in the institution?

We also invite you to participate in our survey on [NEH Funding Impacts](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScItMyAjpoATr2NNehFhrtE308djKIx09hl_X6n_8BLX-BibQ/viewform) We are collecting information about impacts on research. If your NEH work has been impacted, let us know. This form is anonymous, though you can share your contact info if you like.
