The American Historical Association and the Organization of American Historians (OAH) have released [a joint statement](https://www.historians.org/news/aha-oah-statement-on-executive-order-ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/) on the presidential executive order [“Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling.”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/) ACH has signed on in support of this statment which condemns the Executive Order's claims of "radical indoctrination" in history education. 

We do note that this letter leaves out mention of a significant way history education is harmed: the Executive Order's explicit violence toward trans and queer history, and the rights of trans and queer students and educators. For more information on Executive Orders (EOs) and the harmful impact of anti-trans rhetoric about "radical indoctrination" on students and teachers see Courtnie Wolfgang's zine ["Supporting and affirming queer and trans students and their teachers: WTF is the radical indoctrination EO?"](https://zinebakery.com/redistro/support-queer-trans-students-teachers-ri-eo-details)
