ACH is committed to supporting and advocating for digital humanities (DH). While now retracted, the executive order to pause grants, loans, and other federal funding directly impacted DH and has lingering impacts on perceptions of funding stability, labor rights, and the professional risks of engaging in digital research. Our members have greatly benefited from the incredible work of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), particularly the Office of Digital Humanities (ODH). NEH ODH funds cutting-edge, globally-impactful research, and has been an essential force in supporting new and innovative methodologies that are transforming humanities research to meet the needs of the 21st Century. While the effort to freeze federal funding has been halted, we anticipate more actions that will directly adversely affect digital humanities.  

We are working on efforts to advocate for our field, including a letter of support for the NEH and opportunities to augment initiatives from organizations like the National Humanities Alliance. We remain committed to a diverse, inclusive, and supportive DH community forged on our core values of equity and social justice, care and collaboration. Have ideas? Want to get more involved in our efforts to advocate for our field?  Please email [president@ach.org](mailto:president@ach.org).

With care and in solidarity,
ACH Executive
