Is this your first or second time at the Digital Humanities conference? Are you new to the DH community? Join a small group of newbies and DH old-timers at a local Kraków restaurant and make scholarly connections and new friendships. It’s not only for members of the ACH!

The dinners will happen the evening of Wednesday, 13 July 2016, with parties departing from the poster sessions. For ease of conversation, groups will be limited to six people.

Registration is already open and places are limited! [Sign up online](http://bit.ly/ACHdinner16).

On the sign-up form, we will want you to identify yourself with ‘n’ for newbie (in your first or second year attending DH) or ‘v’ for DH conference veteran (no more than 2 veterans per party, please!). We will also need one veteran leader for each group, to make a reservation and walk the group over to the restaurant; long-term ACH members and other DH conference veterans are heartily encouraged to volunteer!

We look forward to meeting you in Poland!

Please note: attendees pay for their own costs. The ACH provides the organization and good cheer.
