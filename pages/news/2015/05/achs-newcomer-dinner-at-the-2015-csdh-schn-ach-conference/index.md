The ACH will extend one of its traditions to the [joint CSDH-SCHN/ACH conference](https://www.conftool.net/csdh-schn-ach-2015/index.php?page=browseSessions&presentations=show) in Ottawa in June with the annual Newcomers’ Dinner on the evening of 1 June 2015. This dinner is a chance for individuals who are new to digital humanities conferences (first- or second-time attendees) to connect with those who have been around for a bit longer. Groups of six will be led by one or two veterans will head to local restaurants where they will get a chance to get to know others in the field. [Sign up or and learn more](https://goo.gl/UDnpJO).

Please note: attendees pay for their own costs. The ACH provides the organization and good cheer.
