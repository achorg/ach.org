The Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) Start-Your-Project award is specifically designed to support small digital projects at various stages of development. The primary goal of these awards is to provide critical support to individuals who might otherwise face barriers in initiating digital scholarship projects due to constraints such as limited financial resources and time commitments within their existing roles. We are particularly enthusiastic about supporting those who aspire to make a meaningful impact but require the necessary support to embark on their work. 

This initiative is designed to be inclusive, recognizing the diverse backgrounds and circumstances of our potential applicants. Whether you are an undergraduate, graduate student, contingent faculty, or staff member, and particularly if at an institution with limited or low resources, these awards aim to help you transform your ideas into tangible projects. This award will offer financial resources of up to $1,000 per project together (with an additional $1,000 for 20 hours of mentorship/consultancy, if requested).

Proposals are due by January 27, 2025. Apply at: [https://bit.ly/2025achawards](https://bit.ly/2025achawards

Please email awards@ach.org with any questions.
