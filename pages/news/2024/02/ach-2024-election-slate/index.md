<!-- /wp:image -->
<p><strong>Bio:&nbsp;</strong>Lawrence Evalyn (he/him) is a Text Mining Specialist at Northeastern University Library in Boston. He holds a Ph.D. in English from the University of Toronto. Previously, he was a Visiting Assistant Professor of English at Northeastern and a Teaching Postdoctoral Fellow at Toronto. His daily work supports computational textual research across domains; his scholarship focuses on women’s writing, queer game studies, technological infrastructure, and the material histories of digital objects.</p>

<p><strong>Statement:</strong>&nbsp;As a student, I benefited enormously from DH organizations to provide community for my work. Now that I have moved to the U.S. and joined ACH, I am eager to contribute back. I am particularly motivated by inclusive pedagogy and sustainable infrastructure. My service record includes serving as the Co-Director of the Digital Integration Teaching Initiative at Northeastern, and supporting the Critical Digital Humanities Initiative at the University of Toronto. In both positions, my specialty has been the unglamorous work of administration: making agendas, taking actionable minutes, and following up on minutiae. Equity and justice so often boil down to the day to day investment of care work; I would be honoured to join in that care for the Digital Humanities community.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:</strong>&nbsp;Rebecca Foote is an Assistant Professor of English and Chicana/o Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles. She received her Ph.D. in English from the University of Virginia in 2023 where she was a Praxis Fellow (2020-2021) with the Scholars’ Lab, the university’s center for digital humanities. Her research focuses on contemporary Latinx poetry and poetics, performance studies, and digital humanities. She is currently working on a book project tentatively titled “Lyric Crossings: Decoloniality in Contemporary Latinx Poetry.” Her work has previously appeared or is forthcoming in Small Axe Archipelagos and MELUS: Multiethnic Literature of the United States.<br><br><strong>Statement</strong>: My introduction to digital humanities came in the form of advice from my undergraduate thesis advisor: “if you’re not collaborating, you’re not doing DH.” Throughout my continued interest in DH, I’ve kept these words at the forefront of my process and thinking, and I hope to continue collaborating nationally and internationally through ACH. Since my introduction to DH, I’ve completed collaborative projects focused on the impacts of Covid-19 on pedagogy and educational spaces and the importance of creating art after the 2017 hurricane season in the Caribbean. Currently, I am working on a project that uses Python to identify the poetic device chiasmus in contemporary Latinx poetry, and I find the range of possibilities in DH scholarship endlessly fascinating. I remain committed to social justice in both my own digital projects and in supporting the work of others, which I would be thrilled to continue on the ACH Executive Council.</p>

<p><strong>4. Jajwalya Karajgikar</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bio:&nbsp;</strong>Jajwalya “Jaj” Karajgikar (M.S.) is the Applied Data Science Librarian at University of Pennsylvania.She helps researchers with their multidisciplinary &amp; multilingual data projects in the form of consultations, collaborations, &amp; conceptual ethical considerations. Her current focus is computational community building efforts on Critical AI Literacy. She makes the most of the tuition benefits at Penn by taking transdisciplinary courses every semester where she manages to weasel in a Digital Humanities project each time. She is currently the co-chair for DH24 conference in the service of the DH community that has given her her life’s calling and sense of belonging.</p>

<p><strong>Statement:&nbsp;</strong>The ACH walks the talk on striving for labour advocacy, true inclusivity, and a strong commitment to a diverse community of intentional care. This is an organization that inspires deeper dedication in service of humanistic &amp; computational community building. ACH members and thus the DH community already offer thought-provoking perspectives on creative, anti-colonial, and feminist technoscience possibilities to a global audience. As a beneficiary of the ACH Grad Student Mentorship cohort program, I believe it would be incredibly valuable for the organization to create a more visible space for international scholars, immigrant scholars, and intersections of queer scholars of color. It is my belief that it is in the specificity that we can feel truly represented. I am also excited to contribute to the longer-term sustainable vision for ACH conference organization &amp; planning in an humane, fun, and collaborative environment, regardless of being selected for this role. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Bio:&nbsp;</strong>Alex Wermer-Colan, Ph.D. is the Interim Academic Director and Digital Scholarship Coordinator of Temple University Libraries’ Loretta C. Duckworth Scholars Studio, where he directs and advises digital research and pedagogical projects across the curriculum. Alex is the Managing Editor of the Programming Historian in English, and he also works as the Executive Director of Philly Community Wireless, a local organization building community internet networks in North Philadelphia. Alex has served as conference organizer and planning committee member for Keystone DH 2021, ACH 2023, and now ADHO 2024. His service to the profession also includes facilitator roles on multiple Digital Library Federation Working Groups for Digital Pedagogy and Digital Accessibility, and he has published in a wide array of venues for digital humanities research, including&nbsp;<em>dh+lib</em>,<em>&nbsp;The Journal of Interactive Technology and Pedagogy</em>,&nbsp;<em>Debates in Digital Humanities</em>, and more. Alex’s work on expanding access to copyrighted collections as data has led to multiple ongoing grant-funded projects from the Mellon Foundation and the Institute for Museum and Library Services.<br><br><strong>Statement:&nbsp;</strong>As an ACH Executive Council member, I hope to contribute to ACH programming and procedures to ensure the organization can uplift and support scholars and teachers in the digital humanities working to expand knowledge, address inequity, and foster collaboration. When I attended the inaugural ACH conference in 2019, it was clear to me that ACH was the welcoming and vibrant community sorely needed in the digital humanities in the United State. Ever since, I’ve sought to contribute to the growth of relevant communities of practice, including by serving as Chair on the organizing committee for Keystone DH 2021, and Co-Platform Lead for the organizing committee for ACH 2023. My work at the intersections of libraries and digital humanities research, both at Temple University Libraries and as Managing Editor of the&nbsp;<em>Programming Historian</em>, has positioned me well to support emerging research in the field, and I would be excited to contribute to ACH’s efforts to expand the range of methodologies, critical perspectives, and scholarly practitioners represented by the organization and related conferences and publications. In particular, I hope to work at ACH to foster new collaborations between organizations at the national and local level, especially to leverage ACH’s breadth to support thriving regional collectives like Keystone DH with a focus on empowering local communities to develop technology and information commons.&nbsp;</p>
