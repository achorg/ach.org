<p>As scholars, practitioners, and activists have widely discussed, AI and other generative technologies require a rethinking of how workers can be protected. These technologies gather and use data generated by workers, generating issues such as wage discrimination and, in the long run, replacement of labor. In this virtual panel,&nbsp;<strong>Enongo Lumba-Kasongo</strong>, rapper (a.k.a. Sammus) and the David S. Josephson Assistant Professor of Music at Brown; and&nbsp;<strong>John Lopez,</strong>&nbsp;producer and member of the AI working group in the Writer's Guild of America, will discuss diverse ways in which AI and other generative systems have affected workers in general and creative workers in particular. They will also discuss their personal perspective and some options they see we have as a society going forward.&nbsp;</p>
