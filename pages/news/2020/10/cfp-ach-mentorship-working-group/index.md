## Description

The ACH invites applications to participate in a one-year mentorship program for graduate students interested in digital humanities work in and around the academy, including libraries, archives, museums, teaching, and research.

This program will bring together a cohort of 5-10 Masters and PhD students interested in the digital humanities for a one-year mentorship program that will provide participants with community building, professional development, and opportunities to help envision the future of mentorship at the ACH.

This program is only open to current students. Early career scholars who have earned their PhDs are encouraged to participate in other ACH mentorship initiatives, including the new mentorship channel on [the DH Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdixlWvNtl2zrrodX9YzP4OmQ0xk5AwPEGZ0qxvlg9nbRReMw/viewform).

To apply: email a one-page cover letter and a two-page resume to [halperta@gmail.com](mailto:halperta@gmail.com), subject: ACH Mentorship Working Group Application. Deadline: October 26, 2020. Details below.

## Goals

This working group will bring together a cohort of 5-10 graduate students interested in the digital humanities for a one-year mentorship program. The program has two goals.

### Goal 1

First, working group participants will become part of a cohort of DH practitioners interested in horizontal mentorship – that is, in building community and supporting one another across various programmatic and professional challenges. The cohort will also have the opportunity to build relationships with DH professionals from across the field. We envision this as a program that will empower students to build their own futures, particularly where institutional structures have failed to provide support.

### Goal 2

Second, the group will work together to propose a comprehensive mentorship program for the Association for Computers in the Humanities. During a time of crisis, we are looking for students on the front lines of the profession to lead us in developing an approach to mentorship that is responsive to the inequities of our disciplines, the inadequacies of our training programs, and the crisis in our economy. Students will work closely with the ACH mentorship subcommittee to develop a plan that will help ACH support students in response to the changing educational and work environment.

## Outcomes

Participation in this program is unpaid. Outcomes of this program that we expect will directly benefit participants include:

1. relationship-building with mid-career DH professionals
2. byline credit for a mentorship proposal that will be published by the ACH,
3. the chance to participate in a special panel on mentorship at the ACH biannual conference
4. CV credit for participating in a working group formally endorsed by the ACH.

## Commitment

Participants in the ACH mentorship working group will be expected to commit to the following:

- Be an active member in the group for nine months (November 2020 – July 2021)
- Participate in 6-8 virtual workshops focused on professional development and community building.
- Collaborate to author a mentorship plan for the Association for Computers in the Humanities.
- Maintain communication through online conversation channels such as Slack.
- Adhere to a collectively-developed code of conduct.

## Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility

Mentorship programs, even with the best intentions, often uphold whiteness and fail to provide lasting pathways to careers for BIPOC, LGBTQ, women, and people with disabilities. One of the goals of the ACH mentorship program is to create an anti-racist agenda that takes into consideration how race is formed and constructed, and the ways that professionalization engages in [racecraft](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/233136/racecraft-by-karen-e-fields-and-barbara-j-fields/) and expects white middle-class conformity.

With a focus on marginalized and minoritized identities in the cohort of mentees and mentors in our cohort, we expect this program to confront implicit biases in workplaces and in the field of digital humanities, with every participant trained in the ethics of care and active listening. Rather than re-establishing the traditional hierarchical structure of mentorship programs, with mentors placed in a higher position than mentees, this program recognizes that the cohort of mentees also has expertise and knowledge to contribute and purposely designs structures to support and develop this knowledge and expertise through processes and tangible products.

Even with these intentions, we expect missteps and ignorances will happen and one of the first steps of the cohort will be to develop a code of conduct, safe and anonymous methods of reporting, and a workflow for mediation when appropriate.
