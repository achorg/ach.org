The Digital Humanities Questions &amp; Answers site, a scholarly forum that was active from 2010 to 2018 and was lost due to server problems, is now available as a [static archive](https://dhanswers.ach.org/), thanks to work by Infrastructure Committee members Rebecca Sutton Koeser, Amanda Visconti, and Zoe LeBlanc. All original URLs under [digitalhumanities.org/answers/](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/) now resolve to equivalent content on the archive site; this means that existing links and citations to DH Q&amp;A content will work again without modification. Although the archive site does not accept new content, it continues to be a useful resource for historical answers to typical questions, especially for those new to DH (e.g. [has anyone created a map or directory of DH?](https://dhanswers.ach.org/topic/map-or-directory-of-digital-humanists/)); perspectives from a variety of practitioners on advanced topics (e.g. [which novels to assign for seminar in algorithmic criticism / distant reading?](https://dhanswers.ach.org/topic/which-novels-to-assign-for-seminar-in-algorithmic-criticism-distant-reading/)); and a snapshot of DH interests and concerns during the site’s active years.

If you’re interested in DH Q&amp;A as a dataset, you can [read about the preliminary dataset](https://github.com/achorg/DH-Answers-Archive/tree/master/data) and [view some initial data analysis](https://github.com/achorg/DH-Answers-Archive/blob/master/data/README.md#initial-data-analysis) about activity on DH Q&amp;A. Please participate in the conversation by opening new issues on the ACH GitHub repository for the archive or commenting on the [work on missing dates](https://github.com/achorg/DH-Answers-Archive/issues/14). Anyone is welcome to use the dataset; we would love to hear about your project if you do!

For questions and answers about DH, the ACH Executive Council recommends asking on the DH Slack’s #dhanswers channel; anyone curious about DH can join the DH Slack by visiting the [sign-up link](http://tinyurl.com/DHSlack).
