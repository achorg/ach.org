The annual Digital Humanities conference is an opportunity for the ACH to pursue in-person many of the initiatives that we support more virtually during the year. We hope you’ll be able to join us for some or all of our events at [DH 2014 in Lausanne](http://dh2014.org)!

## ACH Annual General Meeting and Jobs Slam

The ACH AGM will be held Wednesday, 9 July 2014 at 12:30pm CEST (UTC +1:00) in the Amphimax Building, UNIL, Room 350/351. Join us for a free, healthy, vegetarian-friendly lunch!

Sure, there may be some sub-committee reports and even an important vote or two, but you haven’t really experienced an annual general meeting until you’ve been to an ACH Jobs Slam! This is a lively event where prospective employees and employers have 30 seconds of floor-time to woo each other**.**

We will have a [live webcast of the AGM](http://dharchive.org/stream.html). Use the #achagm hashtag on Twitter (and be sure to follow us at [@ACHdotorg](http://twitter.com/achdotorg)) to ask questions during the meeting.

## ACH Newcomers Dinner

Is this your first or second time at the Digital Humanities conference? Are you new to the DH community? Join a small group of newbies and ACH old-timers at a local restaurant, to make scholarly connections and new friendships.

Dinners will happen the evening of Thursday, 10 July. For ease of conversation, groups are limited to six people. Long-term ACH members and other DH conference veterans are heartily encouraged to volunteer! [Sign up and learn more](http://bit.ly/ach-dinner-dh14).
