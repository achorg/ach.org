The ACH is once again organizing its ACH Newcomers’ Dinner. This year the event will take place Thursday July 10th at DH2014 in Lausanne. These gatherings provide an opportunity for those who are attending DH for the first or second time to get to know others in the community. It’s not only for members of the ACH!
