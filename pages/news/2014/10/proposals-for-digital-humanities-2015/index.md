Get your proposals written and submitted for Digital Humanities 2015, in Sydney, Australia! The conference theme is Global Digital Humanities, and while the program committee welcomes proposals on any aspect of the digital humanities, it especially encourages proposals that address *global* aspects of the digital humanities. See the [Call for Papers](http://dh2015.org/cfp/) for details, and use the [conferenceâ€™s proposal system](https://www.conftool.pro/dh2015/) to submit your proposal.

Especially important to keep in mind are deadlines: the deadline to submit poster, short paper, long paper, and multiple paper session proposals is midnight GMT, 3 November, 2014. In addition, three will be two rounds of workshop and pre-conference tutorial proposals: Round 1 workshop proposals are due by midnight GMT, 1 October, 2014 (with notice of acceptance by 31 October, 2014) and Round 2 workshop proposals are due by midnight GMT, 16 February, 2015 (with notice of acceptance by 27 February, 2015).
