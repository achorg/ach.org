We are delighted to announce the first joint conference between the [Canadian DH](CSHN-SCHN.org) and the Association for Computers and the Humanities. We invite scholars, practitioners, and graduate students to submit proposals for papers, sessions and digital demonstrations during this collective meeting, which will be held at the [2015 Congress of the Social Sciences and Humanities](congress2015.ca), University of Ottawa, Ontario from 1-3 June. We encourage submissions on all topics relating to both theory and practice in the evolving field of the digital humanities.

Proposals for papers (20 min.), digital demonstrations, and panels (2-6 speakers for a 1½ hour session) will be accepted until the <del>1st of December 2014</del> **8th of December 2014** and must be submitted to [https://www.conftool.net/csdh-schn-ach-2015/](https://www.conftool.net/csdh-schn-ach-2015/). Abstracts for paper proposals should be approximately 500 words long, and should clearly indicate the paper’s thesis, methodology and conclusions. We also welcome proposals for Digital Demonstrations of innovative projects or tools. Demonstrations will be given table space and a backdrop so they can set up a poster and a computer for a 2-hour session. We encourage projects with software to show to apply for this venue.

There is a limited amount of funding available to support graduate student travel. Please note that all presenters must be members of ACH or CSDH/SCHN at the time of the conference.

Scholars in the digital humanities are engaged in diverse digital and computer-assisted research, teaching, and creation. ACH and CSDH/SCHN welcome proposals from all constituencies and disciplines, and encourages applications from women, people of color, LGBTQ, or other under-represented groups.

Selected papers from the conference will appear in special collections published in the CSDH/SCHN society journal, [Digital Studies/<span lang="fr">Le champ numérique</span>](http://www.digitalstudies.org/), as well as in the ACH society journal, [Digital Humanitiques Quarterly](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/).
