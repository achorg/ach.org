On Tuesday, the United States Senate Appropriations Committee will hold a full-committee hearing on the subject of “[Driving Innovation through Federal Investments](http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/event/full-committee-hearing-driving-innovation-through-federal-investments).” Testifying at the hearing will be the directors of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and other research-oriented agencies.

The Association for Computers and the Humanities joins [over 100 institutions and organizations](http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings-and-testimony/outside-witness-testimony-federal-innovation-hearing) in expressing to Chairwoman Mikulski and the Committee the great value of federal investment in research and development. What is special about ACH’s response is that it comes from a strong humanities perspective. Humanities investments are investments in innovation.

Read ACH President Bethany Nowviskie’s [submitted testimony](http://www.appropriations.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/Association%20for%20Computers%20and%20the%20Humanities%2C%20UVA%20-%20OWT.pdf) (PDF link), and seek ways to strengthen humanities voices in conversations about federal funding and policy through the [National Humanities Alliance](http://www.nhalliance.org/).
