title: 'Open Letter on Net Neutrality'

## Update: 30 September 2015

The letter was delivered and was used as the basis for the MLA’s letter on the same subject. Earlier this year the [FCC ruled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality#United_States) that broadband is a telecommunications service and that the net should therefore be neutral. Clearly, the ACH didn’t do all the work, but we got what we campaigned for. Thank you all who helped out!

## Update: 30 April 2014

Great interest is being shown in this letter by our various professional communities and colleagues in the digital humanities and aligned fields. Some have requested to sign on. The letter has already been sent to Chairman Wheeler, so we strongly encourage you to modify, adapt, quote, or endorse it in [a new message to the FCC](http://www.fcc.gov/page/fcc-establishes-new-inbox-open-internet-comments), in order to amplify the response. That said, we welcome statements of solidarity in the comments field below. But please do more than add your name: review our [suggested action items](/news/2014/04/net-neutrality/) and readings, which will help you stay alert to other opportunities to work for net neutrality.

## Open Letter

Dear FCC Chairman Wheeler;

We write as leaders of 27 major professional societies, boards, committees, and publications, representing a broad and international community of scholars and students, information professionals, artists, and technologists working in the digital humanities, digital media, and aligned fields.

On behalf of the communities we serve, we urgently ask that you lead the FCC in protecting the fundamental character of the open, nondiscriminatory, creative, and competitive Internet. To do this, the FCC must reclassify broadband service as “common carrier” telecommunications in the United States.

Joining in this appeal are the presidents, chairs, founders, and organizers of:

- the [Association for Computers and the Humanities](/);
- the [Electronic Literature Organization](http://eliterature.org/);
- the [European Association for Digital Humanities](http://eadh.org/);

- [MediaCommons](http://mediacommons.futureofthebook.org/): a digital scholarly network;
- [Humanist](http://dhhumanist.org);
- and [LLC: the Journal of Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/).

Individual members of our organizations — researchers, teachers, students, artists, and technology and information professionals — have lobbied tirelessly for net neutrality protections over the past many years. We write you now on their behalf, as a united alliance of academic leaders.

The scholarly and technical community our organizations represents is a global one, and the world is watching. The United States must follow suit with peers in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East, and elsewhere, to protect the openness and fairness of Internet communication.

True net neutrality:

- stimulates competition, creativity, and innovation;
- protects the freedom of speech;
- and promotes equal and non-discriminatory access to information.

Please fulfill your responsibility to the public and make it possible for the FCC to assert strong network neutrality regulations, by announcing on May 15th that you will reclassify Internet broadband providers as common carriers.
