## Joint ACH/Canadian DH 2015 Conference

Hear ye, hear ye! The joint ACH and CSDH 2015 conference will be held in Ottawa from June 1-3, 2015. This is the first time that the two associations are partnering on a major digital humanities conference in North America, and we hope it’s the start of something beautiful!

The **deadline for proposals is December 1, 2014** ([see CFP](/news/2014/10/joint-ach-canadian-dh-conference-2015/)). Abstracts for paper proposals should be approximately 500 words long, and should clearly indicate the paper’s thesis, methodology and conclusions. We also welcome proposals for Digital Demonstrations of innovative projects or tools. Demonstrations will be given table space and a backdrop so they can set up a poster and a computer for a 2-hour session. Please note that all presenters must be members of ACH or CSDH/SCHN at the time of the conference. There is a limited amount of funding available to support graduate student travel, as well as two Lisa Lena Opas-Hänninen Young Scholar Prizes.

To submit a proposal, visit [the submission website](https://www.conftool.net/csdh-schn-ach-2015/).

Hope to see many of you in Ottawa this June!

## ACH Elections 2014 Update

We are collaborating with our OUP colleagues to set up the annual elections voting system. A few delays along the way mean that we will open polls slightly later than the usual early December. We hope to be ready by mid-December; please watch around then for an email ballot from Oxford University Press!
