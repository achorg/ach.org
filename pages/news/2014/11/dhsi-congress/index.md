The [<abbr title="Digital Humanities Summer Institue">DHSI</abbr>](http://dhsi.org), [<abbr title="Society for Digital Humanities">CSDH</abbr>/<abbr lang="fr" title="Société canadienne des humanités numériques">CSHN</abbr>](http://csdh-schn.org/) and [<abbr title="Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences">CFHSS</abbr>](http://www.ideas-idees.ca/) are pleased to announce the [DHSI@Congress](http://www.dhsi.org/events.php), a series of 2.5-hour workshops for scholars, staff, and students interested in a hands-on introduction to the ways that traditional and digital methods of teaching, research, and dissemination intersect and enhance one another.

The DHSI@Congress workshops, which run on Saturday May 30th and Sunday May 31st at the Canadian Congress of the Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Ottawa, are built on the community model of the Digital Humanities Summer Institute at the University of Victoria (to find out more about the DHSI in Victoria, now in its 12th year, please visit the [DHSI website](http://www.dhsi.org/)). The DHSI@Congress sessions, facilitated by established scholars and emerging leaders in the field, introduce a wide range of Digital Humanities methods and methodologies from 3D printing to DH pedagogy, from text analysis to database development (and more!). We invites interested Congress attendees to register for any and all workshops that engage their interest at the [DHSI@Congress web page](http://www.dhsi.org/events.php)

The sessions will conclude with a plenary address by [Brian Greenspan](http://www.carleton.ca/english/people/greenspan-brian/), founding director of Carleton University’s [Hyperlab](http://www3.carleton.ca/hyperlab/). The plenary, on May 31st at 4:30, is free and open to the public.

Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors and hosts, all spots in the workshops are made available via a tuition scholarship, requiring only the payment of a $25 administrative fee for each session. DHSI@Congress has been developed by the DHSI in partnership with the Society for Digital Humanities/<span lang="fr">Société canadienne des humanités numériques</span> (CSDH/SCHN) and the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences (CFHSS). The 2015 workshops will be delivered in English, with plans for French-language sessions in coming years.
