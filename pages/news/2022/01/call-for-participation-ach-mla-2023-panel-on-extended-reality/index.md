How can Extended Reality (XR) technologies (Virtual, Augmented, Mixed) be applied to the teaching and study of language and literature? What new questions do these technologies enable us to ask? How might they extend or intersect with other areas of digital humanities work? For our session at the 2023 MLA Convention (January 5-8 in San Francisco CA), ACH invites proposals related to the use of extended reality technologies as they pertain to research and teaching related to language, literature, and related fields. Speakers will give short presentations (4-6 minutes depending on the number of participants) describing their work with XR methods.

Proposals should be no more than 250 words. Please also include a short one-paragraph biographical statement. Proposals can be emailed to Brandon Walsh at [bmw9t@virginia.edu](mailto:bmw9t@virginia.edu) by March 1st. Since the ACH is an allied organization of the MLA, this session is guaranteed to be accepted for the 2023 MLA convention. All accepted panelists will need to be current MLA membersâ€”or have their membership waived by April 7, 2022.
