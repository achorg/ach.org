The Association for Computers and the Humanities is pleased to announce two more incoming Executive Council members. They will be taking over the remaining terms of two representatives who had to step down! They are Pamella Lach and Jim McGrath. Their term will begin at the annual Executive Council meeting on July 27th, 2022. We are excited about the incoming class of Executive Council members, as they will bring the ideas and experiences that enrich ACH activities for our commitment as an organization.
