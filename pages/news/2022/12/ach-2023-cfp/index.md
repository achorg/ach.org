The Association for Computers and the Humanities seeks proposals for ACH 2023, our virtual conference, to be held June 29-July 1, 2023. We welcome a broad range of topics, with a particular emphasis on social justice in multiple contexts: anti-racist work, Indigenous studies, cultural and critical ethnic studies, intersectional feminism, postcolonial and decolonial studies, disability studies, and queer studies. We also prioritize proposals that explicitly address multilingualism in digital humanities, which is itself a matter of social justice.

Areas of digital humanities scholarship that are relevant to the conference include but are not limited to:

- Digital and computational approaches to humanistic research and pedagogy
- Digital cultural heritage
- Digital surveillance
- Environmental humanities &amp; climate justice
- Digital humanities tools and infrastructures
- Digital librarianship
- Digital media, art, literature, history, music, film, and games
- Digital public humanities
- Humanistic and ethical approaches to data science and data visualization
- Humanistic research on digital objects and cultures
- Humanities knowledge infrastructures
- Labor and organization in digital humanities
- Physical computing
- Resource creation, curation, and engagement
- Use of digital technologies to write, publish, and review scholarship

Submission types include: papers (12-15 minutes), lightning talks (5 minutes), posters, panels (1 hour and 15 minutes), roundtables (1 hour and 15 minutes), installations and performances, and alternate formats (variable length).

Proposals are due **February 15, 2023**. The full CFP is available in English, Spanish, and French on the [conference website](https://ach2023.ach.org).
