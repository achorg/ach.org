ACH seeks three new Executive Council Representatives to serve a 4-year term (2023-2027).

**Nominations are due January 15, 2023 via the [very brief nomination form](https://forms.gle/iCuZAj8YK8gLm4MA7).**

## What does an ACH Executive Council Representative do?

As an organization, ACH regularly runs a conference, a series of mentoring events, and distributes bursaries and other awards to the community. ACH has also been involved in advocacy work on behalf of the digital humanities community in the United States. This work is supported by infrastructure run and maintained by the ACH exec, and is informed by a series of liaison relationships with other organizations. Executive Council representatives shape and execute these threads of work on behalf of the organization.

## What is the time commitment for an ACH Executive Council Representative?

The council meets once a month for an hour. Typically the beginnings of these meetings are spent on any business requiring council input. The remaining time is used for a working meeting to tackle ACH tasks.

The work of ACH is organized into tasks. These could be as small as “organize a professional development event” or as large as “chair the conference program committee.” Over the course of a year, we ask each council member to commit to 4-5 small tasks or 1 large (conference-related) task to ensure that the organization’s work is fairly distributed among council members.

## Who is eligible to be an ACH Executive Council Representative?

Anyone who is a current ACH member (or who is willing to join ACH if elected) and is willing to perform the work of the organization and advocate for our membership and other digital humanists is eligible.

## Who are we looking for?

We especially hope for a slate of candidates that is diverse as to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, ability, profession, citizenship, nationality, and other identities and backgrounds.

Demonstrated commitment to digital humanities is more important to our work than professional affiliation, academic/professional status, or job title. We welcome participants not just from universities and colleges, but also galleries, libraries, museums, community groups, and other organizations engaged with the digital humanities, as well as independent scholars. We seek individuals with and without academic or professional degrees, including current students.

## How does nomination work?

You are encouraged to self-nominate, as well as nominate others, using the very brief nomination form.

The Nominations committee will follow up with nominees later in January to request brief candidate materials – a short candidate bio and summary of their interest in serving ACH.

Sample candidate bios and statements from [last year’s election](/news/2022/02/ach-2022-elections-slate/) are available. For more information on the responsibilities and obligations of Executive Council members, please see [our Bylaws](http://www.ach.org/about/constitution).

For questions about nominations please contact ACH presidents, Roopika Risam ([rrisam@salemstate.edu](mailto:rrisam@salemstate.edu)) and Quinn Dombrowski ([qad@stanford.edu](mailto:qad@stanford.edu)).

## About ACH

ACH is the US-based professional organization for digital humanities. ACH supports and disseminates research and cultivates a vibrant professional community through conferences, publications, and outreach activities. ACH advocates for and supports all of our members in their digital humanities work. Digital humanities is a broad term encompassing a wide range of subject domains, methods, and communities of practice, including (but not limited to) computer-assisted research, pedagogy, and software; resource creation, curation, and engagement; physical computing; the use of digital technologies to write, publish, and review scholarship; and humanistic research into and about digital objects and culture. ACH recognizes that this work is inherently and inextricably sociopolitical, and thus advocates for social change through the use of computers and related technologies in the study of humanistic subjects.
