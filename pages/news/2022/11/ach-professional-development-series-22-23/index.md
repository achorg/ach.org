**Making DH Work for Us: Labor, Care, and Careers**

How do your digital humanities interests, experiences, and aspirations connect to careers within and beyond higher ed? The answer to that question will vary, depending on who you are and what you’d like to do with your DH knowledge. Join ACH Council representatives with a range of professional backgrounds and career paths to talk about labor, ethics, care, and other factors that influence our careers as well as the lives we live off the clock. Designed primarily for graduate students, early career scholars, and other folks in and around ACH who are thinking about new horizons, these sessions are meant to generate ongoing dialogue, connect you to things you can do in the short-term, and inspire you to connect with peers who want to improve the professional futures of digital humanities for everyone.

## Session #1: Discerning the Kind of Work You Want To Do

**Nov 17, 12-1 pm EST, Jim McGrath and Katina Rogers**

Professional development is great, but how do you even know what kind of work you want to do in the future? In this first session of Making DH Work for Us, Jim McGrath and Katina Rogers will discuss the complexities of discerning where you want your future to take you. We will make space for exploration and talk about how you might do the same in your work. We’ll also delve into concrete advice to help you survive and thrive—such as dimensions of cultural and political capital, navigating institutional expectations, useful resources, and more.

## Session #2: Professional Development Beyond Academia: Engaging Diverse Communities in the Digital Humanities

**March 1, 2-3 pm EST, Eduard Arriaga, Katina Rogers, Hannah Alpert-Abrams, and Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla**

Join us Wednesday, March 1 from 2-3pm EST for the second discussion in the ACH Mentorship and Professional Development series, “Making DH Work for Us: Labor, Care, and Careers.” For this special session, Eduard Arriaga and Katina Rogers will be joined by co-facilitators Hannah Alpert-Abrams and Sylvia Fernández Quintanilla. The landscape of DH is rapidly transforming not only because of the professional pressures of academia but also because of the numerous technological developments. If ten years ago we thought the DH center and the university were the main sources of knowledge and experience for DH practitioners, we may need to rethink those assumptions today. This session will question the basic conception of professional development against the backdrop of a changing professional landscape.
