The Association for Computers and the Humanities joins our colleagues in the [European Association for Digital Humanities](https://eadh.org/eadh-statement-ukraine-invasion) in condemning the Putin regime’s invasion of Ukraine, and expressing our solidarity with the Ukrainian nation and its people, as well as those in Russia who oppose the actions of their government.

We second EADH’s call to extend any possible help to our Ukrainian colleagues and the Ukrainian society, and we stand with our colleagues, with Ukrainian-Americans, and with Ukrainians in our own country in readiness to provide any support we can.

We encourage our members, if they are in the position to do so at their institutions, to reach out to their international education offices to enquire how they might support Ukrainian students and visiting scholars, as well as any colleagues with family and friends in Ukraine.
