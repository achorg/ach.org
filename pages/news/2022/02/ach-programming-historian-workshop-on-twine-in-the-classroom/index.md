The ACH mentoring group is sponsoring a yearlong, public book club based on the English-language version of *Programming Historian*. Open to all (including non-members of ACH), newcomers to the topic and to digital humanities work through a *Programming Historian* lesson together in a supportive environment with one or two more experienced participants able to help and answer questions. The workshop this semester will take place on April 13th from 3:00-4:30, featuring one of the most recent articles in the journal “[Interactive Fiction in the Humanities Classroom: How to Create Interactive Text Games Using Twine](https://ach.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=dedf14e24c9607061dd051606&id=377e56dbda&e=f813d57106)” presented by its author Dr. Gabi Kirilloff.
