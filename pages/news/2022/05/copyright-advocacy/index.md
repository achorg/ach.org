From the [Google Books](/news/2012/10/ach-advocacy-news/) case to [exemptions to the DMCA](/news/2021/12/ach-advocacy-leads-to-new-opportunities-for-text-and-video-analysis/), ACH has been active in advocating for the interests of the digital humanities community with regard to copyright law, especially as it intersects with computational analysis.

If you’re interested in helping contribute to this advocacy work, we’ve [set up a mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/ach.org/g/copyright) where we’ll be following up with opportunities for you to get involved. If copyright law and access to digital materials impacts your scholarship, please join us!
