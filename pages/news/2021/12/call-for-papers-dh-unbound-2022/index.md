ACH and [CSDH/SCHN](https://csdh-schn.org/) are the U.S.-based and Canada-based constituent organizations in the Alliance for Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO), respectively. Together, we are hosting a virtual conference, [DH Unbound 2022](http://dhunbound2022.ach.org), from May 17-19, 2022.

Check out our call for papers in [English](https://dhunbound2022.ach.org/cfp-english/), [Spanish](https://dhunbound2022.ach.org/cfp-espanol/), and [French](https://dhunbound2022.ach.org/cfp-francais/), and [submit your proposal](https://www.conftool.org/dhunbound2022) by January 15, 2022!

Reviving a collaboration that began with the [Joint CSDH/SCHN and ACH Conference](/news/2014/10/joint-ach-canadian-dh-conference-2015/) in 2015, DH Unbound facilitates collaboration between ACH, CSDH/SCHN, and other organizations sharing our commitment to creating virtual and hybrid spaces that showcase the diverse practices within digital humanities.

DH Unbound 2022 provides a forum for conversations about digital humanities in a broad range of subject areas, methods, languages, and communities of practice.

- **Tuesday, May 17th and Wednesday, May 18th** will feature an array of synchronous presentations on a variety of topics in digital humanities drawn from the submission pool to DH Unbound 2022.
- **Thursday, May 19th** will feature a hybrid crossover between DH Unbound 2022 and the [Humanistica](http://www.humanisti.ca/) 2022 Conference (taking place in Montreal from May 19th-21st) with synchronous presentations drawn from submissions to both the virtual DH Unbound 2022 and the Humanistica 2022 conferences.
