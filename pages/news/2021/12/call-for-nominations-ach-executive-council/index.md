ACH seeks three new Executive Council Representatives to serve a 4-year term (2022-2026) as well as one or more Vice-President/President Elect(s). The current co-VPs will be available to answer questions via email, or at a [Zoom event on December 15th at 4 PM Eastern / 1 PM Pacific](https://members.ach.org/civicrm/event/info/?reset=1&id=16).

**Nominations are due January 15, 2022 via the [very brief nomination form](https://forms.gle/ArjUasbQKkn7hZis5).**

## What does an ACH Executive Council Representative do?

As an organization, ACH regularly runs a conference, a series of mentoring events, and distributes bursaries and other awards to the community. ACH has also been involved in advocacy work on behalf of the DH community in the United States. This work is supported by infrastructure run and maintained by the ACH exec, and is informed by a series of liaison relationships with other organizations. Executive Council representatives shape and execute these threads of work on behalf of the organization.

Anyone who is a current ACH member (or who is willing to join ACH if elected) and is willing to perform the work of the organization and advocate for our membership and other digital humanists is eligible.

## What does a Vice-President/President-Elect do?

The Vice President/President-Elect serves as VP for two years, followed by a term as President for another two years. The VP is an Officer position and plays a more active role in taking leadership on shaping major initiatives and the direction of the organization as a whole. We encourage candidates to run jointly as co-VPs with a candidate from a different professional background.

## Who are we looking for?

We especially hope for a slate of candidates that is diverse as to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, ability, profession, citizenship, nationality, and other identities and backgrounds.

Demonstrated commitment to the ACH and/or to DH is more important to our work than professional affiliation, academic/professional status, or job title. We welcome participants not just from universities and colleges, but also galleries, libraries, museums, community groups, and other organizations engaged with the digital humanities. We seek individuals with and without academic or professional degrees, including current students. Serving on the ACH Exec involves attending quarterly meetings of the Exec, where you will report on the status of the tasks you have taken on (e.g. organizing events, taking on Twitter responsibilities, awarding bursaries) on behalf of the organization. The work expectation is around an hour per week, though this may be concentrated at particular times (e.g. if you are part of the conference committee) depending on what you decide to focus on.

## How does nomination work?*

You are encouraged to self-nominate, as well as nominate others, using the very brief [nomination form](https://forms.gle/ArjUasbQKkn7hZis5).

All are welcome to attend the [Q&amp;A event for running for ACH Exec or (co-VP) on December 15 at 4 PM Eastern](https://members.ach.org/civicrm/event/info/?reset=1&id=16).

The Nominations committee will follow up with nominees later in January to request brief candidate materials – a short candidate bio and summary of your interest in serving ACH.

Sample candidate statements from [past elections](/news/2020/03/ach-2020-elections-candidate-statements/) are available, though please note we’ve changed the questions and added a maximum word cap this year. For more information on the responsibilities and obligations of Executive Council members, please see [our Bylaws](/about/constitution).

For questions about nominations please contact co-VPs, Roopika Risam ([rrisam@salemstate.edu](mailto:rrisam@salemstate.edu)) and Quinn Dombrowski ([qad@stanford.edu](mailto:qad@stanford.edu)).

## About ACH

ACH is the US-based professional organization for digital humanities. ACH supports and disseminates research and cultivates a vibrant professional community through conferences, publications, and outreach activities. ACH advocates for and supports all of our members in their digital humanities work. Digital humanities is a broad term encompassing a wide range of subject domains, methods, and communities of practice, including (but not limited to) computer-assisted research, pedagogy, and software; resource creation, curation, and engagement; physical computing; the use of digital technologies to write, publish, and review scholarship; and humanistic research into and about digital objects and culture. ACH recognizes that this work is inherently and inextricably sociopolitical, and thus advocates for social change through the use of computers and related technologies in the study of humanistic subjects.
