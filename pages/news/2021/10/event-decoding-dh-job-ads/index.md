If you’re thinking of applying for DH jobs in faculty or alt-ac roles, join ACH Mentoring for a “Decoding DH Job Ads” event on November 5th at 12 PM Eastern / 9 AM Pacific! Amanda Henrichs, Zoe LeBlanc, and Katie MacDonough will walk through real DH job ads to explain what they’re actually asking for. We’ll also cover how job ads and the application process work differently in the UK and Australia.

This event will be held November 5th at 12 PM Eastern / 9 AM Pacific, and will last until 10:30 AM Pacific.
