This year’s virtual MLA Convention featured a [Digital Project Showcase,](https://mla.confex.com/mla/2021/meetingapp.cgi/Session/10082) where several scholars presented work that is ongoing or just getting started. We’re very pleased to share [the slides that were shown in that panel](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O1k4q6Rz1J1Mray4l8VFDko31lsf5iBc2a_W4aZ__jE/edit?usp=sharing), introducing the projects in question.

The showcase featured projects from Kendra Leonard ([SHEAF: Shakespeare in Early Film](https://sheaf.hcommons.org/)), Grant Glass (An Adaptive Methodology: Using Machine Learning to Identify Adaptations), Benoit Berthelier (Detecting clichés and stock characters in North Korean fiction), Illya Nokhrin ([eREED: Records of Early English Drama](https://ereed.library.utoronto.ca/)), Lorena Gauthereau ([US Latino Digital Humanities](https://artepublicopress.com/projects/)), John Misak (Perchance to Learn: leveraging video games and mixed reality to teach literature), Lisa Rhody ([Digital Humanities Research Institute](https://www.dhinstitutes.org/)), Annie Galvin ([Public Books 101](http://www.publicbooks.org/podcast/)), and Graham Jensen ([Canadian Modernist Magazines Project](https://www.modernistmags.ca)). Many thanks to all of them for joining us to discuss their work!
