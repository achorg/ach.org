In just three months, our microgrants are already starting to bear fruit. Earlier this week, [Amanda Visconti](http://literaturegeek.com/) published her project, [View DHQ](http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/), which provides visualizations of citation networks in the *[Digital Humanities Quarterly](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/)*.

Amanda also blogged about the project in a two-part series: "[Visualizing Data from the Digital Humanities Quarterly](http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt1/)" and "[Getting Started with Gephi for DH Vis](http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/07/11/viewdhqpt2/)". Nice work, Amanda!
