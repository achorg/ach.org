Today, the ACH issued a response to two [Requests for Information](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/11/07/request-information-public-access-digital-data-and-scientific-publications) made by the US White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

On behalf of the digital humanities community we represent, ACH strongly advocates open access to federally-funded research and research publications, and the inclusion of humanities voices in these crucial conversations.

We urge ACH members and other interested individuals to respond as well. The OSTP's deadline is January 12th.
