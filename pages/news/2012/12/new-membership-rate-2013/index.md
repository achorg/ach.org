Great news for students, early-career professionals, and unwaged or low-waged independent scholars!

You can now [join ACH](https://members.ach.org/) as a joint [ADHO](http://adho.org) member at the extremely low cost of $25.  

This annual fee entitles you to all the regular benefits of ACH (and joint ADHO) membership, including reduced registration fees at events like [Digital Humanities 2013](http://dh2013.unl.edu), the ability to vote in elections and be elected to leadership positions in our association, eligibility for young-scholar bursaries at conferences and workshops and for opportunities like [ACH microgrants](/news/2012/04/ach-announces-microgrants-winners), and all our other programs and services. Your fees will also contribute to a number of ACH and ADHO open access publishing ventures, including [Digital Humanities Quarterly](http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/) and [DH Questions and Answers](http://digitalhumanities.org/answers)!

Just choose the “Student rate – Society fee” option on our OUP-managed [subscription site](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/litlin/access_purchase/price_list.html). (An improved interface for joining ACH and ADHO is in the works!)

A subscription to *LLC: the journal of digital scholarship in the humanities* is, however, not included at this level of membership. Students wishing to subscribe to the journal as part of their memberships are encouraged to do so at an annual cost of $72 (ACH only) or $87 (joint ADHO membership). Institutional subscriptions and individual membership support for *LLC* funds the good work of [ADHO](http://digitalhumanities.org) associations worldwide.

If financial concerns have prevented you from becoming an ACH member in the past, we happily and warmly invite you to [join us](https://members.ach.org/) now.
