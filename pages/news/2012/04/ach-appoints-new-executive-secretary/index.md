She takes the place of [Dot Porter](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dot-porter/a/937/482), Associate Director for Digital Library Content &amp; Services at Indiana University, who is stepping down from the position of Executive Secretary to devote more time to the development of MESA, the Medieval Electronic Scholarly Alliance.
