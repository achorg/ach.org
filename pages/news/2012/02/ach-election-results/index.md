Thanks very much to all the candidates and to these individuals for being willing to serve — and thanks also to all who voted. Thanks are also due to the nominations committee (Dot Porter \[chair\], Neil Fraistat, Brian Pytlik Zillig, and Bill Turkel) for preparing such a strong slate, and to all those who agreed to stand as candidates.

Finally, we offer our warm thanks to the outgoing members of the Council, Paul Caton, Bethany Nowviskie, Stéfan Sinclair, and Susan Schreibman, for their many years of service and their contributions to the ACH.

Julia Flanders (outgoing President, ACH)
