The Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) is soliciting [self-nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexMFM_72RP67L1zJzm5CTF4eDMz-ZMmkW3tqThk52Uh8VoKw/viewform) for ACH members to serve on the Program Committee (PC) for the international [ADHO DH2020 conference](https://www.adho.org/announcements/2017/announcing-location-dh-2020), to be held in Ottawa, Canada. The PC approves the structure and content of the entire academic program; serving on this committee offers ACH members an opportunity to help shape this large global DH conference.

Expectations:

- It is expected that PC members will be active, engaged, and timely in their duties.
- PC members should be willing and able to commit a minimum of 5 hours per month in the first year (2018-2019) with additional hours (10 or more) being needed in 2019-2020 as the Program Committee begins the bulk of its work.
- PC members are expected to begin work in June 2018; work continues through the closing of the 2020 conference.
- It is strongly recommended that PC members have attended recent international DH conferences in Montreal (2017) or Mexico City (2018), as well as the 2019 conference in Utrecht
- Activities associated with the PC will be governed by the [ADHO Conference Code of Conduct](http://adho.org/administration/conference-coordinating-program-committee/adho-conference-code-conduct), the [Conference Protocol](http://adho.org/administration/conference-coordinating/adho-conference-protocol), the [Conference Annex](http://adho.org/administration/conference-coordinating/annex-adho-conference-protocol), and all relevant ADHO policies.

Please review these documents prior to committing to this service.
