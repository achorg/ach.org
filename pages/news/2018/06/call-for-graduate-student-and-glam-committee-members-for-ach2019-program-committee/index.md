Recognizing how the digital humanities bridge conventional academic distinctions, The Association of Computers and Humanities (ACH) seek two members to join the organizing committee for the 2019 program committee from across the field, including: those working in Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums as well as early-career graduate students with interests in digital scholarship. We are ideally looking for one representative from the graduate student community and one representative from the cultural heritage community.

This is an excellent opportunity for cultural heritage professionals and graduate students to gain experience in conference organizing. Participation in this planning committee offers a unique CV line and potential mentorship opportunities in the field.

Expressions of interest should be sent via [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ozMlHSg9CH7kqjtOSV5Xy1J5nrmRWVHuMzk1DRIpSyE).

Feel free to contact [Heather Froehlich](mailto:hgf5@psu.edu) and [Nabil Kashyap](mailto:nkashya1@swarthmore.edu) with any questions.
