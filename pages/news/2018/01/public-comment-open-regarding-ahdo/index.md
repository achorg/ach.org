At its yearly meeting on July 10, 2016, the ADHO Steering Committee approved a new [governance framework](http://www.adho.org/administration/steering/adho-governance-proposals) and a new financial model. An Implementation Committee (IC), comprised of Geoffrey Rockwell (Chair), Melissa Terras, Christian-Emil Smith Ore, and Jennifer Guiliano has started to work on a more detailed plan that will help to smooth the way for the official change to the new structure effective July 1, 2018.

The Implementation Committee suggested a [draft roadmap](http://change.adho.org/implementation-committee-roadmap/), following the ADHO governance proposals and other related documents.

The first recommendations of the Implementation Committee, concerning the [Proposed Financial Scenarios](http://change.adho.org/proposed-financial-scenarios/) are now published for public comment.

Please take a moment to review and offer comment on the roadmap and/or the Financial Scenarios via the [Change ADHO website](http://change.adho.org/). Comments can also be sent to any member of the ACH Executive Committee to be shared with ADHO.
