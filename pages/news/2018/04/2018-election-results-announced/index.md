We are pleased to announce the results of the 2018 ACH election, in which three new executive council members and a Vice President/President-Elect were elected.

**Kathleen Fitzpatrick** was elected to serve as our next Vice President in 2018-2020, followed by a term as President in 2020-2022. **Paige Morgan**, **Angel David Nieves**, and **Lauren Tilton** were elected to serve on the Executive Council for the 2018-2022 term. All new terms will begin at the close of the annual summer Executive Council meeting, to take place at the DH2018 conference in Mexico City.

Many congratulations to the elected candidates! We are thrilled to have you on board. Heartfelt thanks also to all of the candidates in this yearâ€™s strong slate for their willingness to serve on the ACH Executive Board.
