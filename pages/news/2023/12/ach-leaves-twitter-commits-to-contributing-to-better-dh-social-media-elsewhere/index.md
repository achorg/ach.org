The ACH is leaving Twitter: we're locking our Twitter account, and will no longer post, read, nor reply there. ACH members and the broader digital humanities community can find us on Bluesky (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ach.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bsky.app/profile/ach.bsky.social</a>), Mastodon (<a href="https://hcommons.social/@ach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hcommons.social/@ach</a>), our website (<a href="https://ach.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ach.org</a>); and for ACH members, our newsletter (<a href="https://members.ach.org/join/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">members.ach.org/join</a>).

<strong>Why we're leaving Twitter</strong>

We leave Twitter because of its rapidly increasing harms—both policies that are explicitly racist, sexist, transphobic, and harmful in many additional ways; and policy (non)implementation and culture that make the space harmful or impossible for many to use. This is in keeping with the ACH's mission, which states:
<blockquote>"ACH recognizes that this work is inherently and inextricably sociopolitical, and thus advocates for social change through the use of computers and related technologies in the study of humanistic subjects."</blockquote>
We recognize this is not a decision everyone can make—for example, unemployed and precarious community members can't afford to miss anywhere jobs might be posted. If we don't put opportunities and other info on Twitter, people don't have to expose themselves to the most blatant harms to get that info. We leave Twitter to contribute toward ending that lock-in. Please let the organizations you're part of know, if their moving off Twitter would help you be able to leave too. If you're an organization or individual who can safely do so, we encourage you to help everyone leave Twitter by leaving yourself.

<strong>A proactive approach</strong>

The ACH is delighted to announce our support of a newly convened ACH Working Group: <em>(Re)connecting DH on Social Media</em>! Watch this blog for a future post on its plans for proactively improving and (re)connecting DH social media community. (You can also <a href="https://ach.org/blog/2023/08/15/ach-seeks-working-group-proposals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read more about</a>, and consider proposing, ACH Working Groups on other topics yourself.)

We want to not only help folks get off Twitter—we're planning to actively support other platforms becoming safer and better, and support DH community in participating and finding community there. See below for info on how to move off Twitter, and options for where you can go.

<strong>How do I use other platforms &amp; rebuild my networks?</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Choosing a platform
<ol>
 	<li>ACH is active on both Mastodon and Bluesky. There are other options we're not currently active on, including Meta's Instagram and Threads; see the "Where can I find DH community online?" section below for a list of platforms as well as ways to find DH within platforms (e.g. servers, feeds, hashtags).</li>
 	<li>Bluesky is closest to the Twitter experience, so may be an easier switch. You currently need an invite code, but luckily there's <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLFxq9h9NzPq5KVYYKFqL5gH7rjK0lp46Rf_G2lgd39u44Rw/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a quick way</a> for DHers to receive one.</li>
 	<li>Mastodon has some differences from Twitter that give it a learning curve, but it also gives you more control over your content ownership and the politics/policies impacting what you post. You do not need an invite code to get started.</li>
</ol>
</li>
 	<li>Moving to Bluesky
<ol>
 	<li>Fill out Quinn Dombrowski and Brandon Walsh's <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLFxq9h9NzPq5KVYYKFqL5gH7rjK0lp46Rf_G2lgd39u44Rw/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quick form to get a Bluesky invite code sooner</a> than through the official waitlist. Thanks to Quinn and Brandon for running this effort, and to all the folks who have contributed invite codes to help colleagues make the move to Bluesky!</li>
 	<li>See Amanda Visconti's <a href="https://tinyurl.com/DHbluesky" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DH Bluesky Guide</a> to quickly get started, followed by friendly in-depth discussion of more advanced Bluesky use (when/if you're ready for it)..</li>

Many communities are listed <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/servers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. You can interact across communities unless the community of users decides not to connect.</li>
 	<li>As ACH joined <a href="https://hcommons.social/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hcommons.social</a>, we recommend you become part of the community to be connected to other humanities scholars and DH practitioners.</li>

<strong>Where can I find DH community online?</strong>
