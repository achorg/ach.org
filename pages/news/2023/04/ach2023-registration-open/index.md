Acceptance decisions for ACH 2023 are now available. We received so many wonderful proposals—more than we could accept for our three-day virtual conference. The program committee is deeply appreciative of our community of reviewers for their careful consideration and feedback.

Registration for the conference is [now open](https://members.ach.org/civicrm/event/info/?id=20&reset=1). ACH has a limited number of bursaries to cover registration costs for graduate students and contingent/un-/underemployed professionals. In order to be eligible, you must be a member of ACH (if you’re not yet a member, you can [join ACH](https://members.ach.org/) now). [Bursary applications](https://tinyurl.com/ACH2023Bursaries) are due by May 5, 2023.

We’ll be sharing program details, including our keynote speakers, in the coming weeks. Questions can be directed to the conference committee at [conference@ach.org](mailto:conference@ach.org).
