The Association for Computers and the Humanities is pleased to announce the results of our 2023 elections. We had a slate of nineteen stellar candidates, and we are grateful to all the digital humanities practitioners for rising to the occasion of being nominees and willing to work at this organizational level.

The 2023-27 ACH Executive Council members are, in alphabetical order: Dorothy Berry, Sylvia Fern√°ndez, and Lauren Klein.

The terms of our newly elected Executive Council members will start at the close of the annual summer Executive Council meeting in July 2023. We are excited about the incoming class of Executive Council members and the ideas and experiences they will bring to ACH!
