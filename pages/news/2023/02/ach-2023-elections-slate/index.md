## Executive Council

### Stefka Hristova

#### Bio

Dr. Stefka Hristova (she/her/hers) is an Associate Professor of Digital Media at Michigan Technological University. She holds a PhD in Visual Studies with an emphasis on Critical Theory from the University of California, Irvine. Her research analyzes digital and algorithmic visual culture. She is the lead editor for *Algorithmic Culture: How Big Data and Artificial Intelligence are Transforming Everyday Life* (Lexington Books, 2021) and the author of *Proto-Algorithmic War: How the Iraq War Became a Laboratory for Algorithmic Logics* (Palgrave 2022).

#### Statement

I am interested in serving on the ACH Executive Council and advancing the transdisciplinary collaborations that this organization fosters. As everyday life is increasingly shaped by algorithmic technologies, a collaborative inquiry is becoming a necessity. I would like to help facilitate sessions for exploratory networked scholarship that can function as incubators for research projects. Low-stake networking events could broaden participation in digital humanities as well as critical algorithmic studies for scholars who might be interested in exploring such methods but feel intimidated by engaging with computational methods. Workshops, research escalators, mentorships, and collaborator recommendations might be worth exploring as ways to allow for broader transdisciplinary engagement. I believe that the multidisciplinary perspectives reflected in the work ACH position this organization to continue to be a leading hub for such work, and am excited for the opportunity to contribute to its success.

### Dorothy Berry

#### Statement

I want to express my gratitude for this nomination and my enthusiasm for pursuing election. Digital humanities practitioners have continually made space for me in academia and it is my hope to continue showing those who work in the margins and who have a love of technology that their work can flourish here. I would look forward to being able to connect the ACH Executive Committee with the work of the American Studies Association Digital Humanities Caucus, where I currently serve as Vice Chair. It is my hope to bring creativity and advocacy for a myriad of different digital projects, pedagogy and theory that may have been previously overlooked. This appreciation for experimentation and an eye toward the margin in DH is what keeps me inspired and ready to work.

### John Russell

#### Bio

### Saniya Irfan

#### Bio

I graduated from the esteemed Department of English at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi. Currently, I’m a PhD scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi. I’m interested in Urdu literary traditions and Performance Aesthetics, Digital Humanities, Corpus Linguistics and Islamic political history and thought. I was also a summer research project fellow at the Michigan State University and part of the Ministry of Education sponsored SPARC project, ‘Digital Apprehensions of Indian Poetics’ at Jamia Millia Islamia. I am working in Urdu Corpus Linguistics and NLP tools as a part of my PhD project.

#### Statement

There are a handful of Indian institutes which offer only certificate courses in Digital Humanities. The discipline is still in its nascent stage and is yet to make its space within literary scholarship in India. The institutional resistance to fund DH, fewer trainings, workshops, people, collaborations, lack of infrastructural support are some of the hurdles that DH scholars face in India. I believe that I should be a part of the Executive Council of ACH because I wish to introduce DH to a wider South Asian student community, especially the newly emerging, by making them aware of the new trends and also speaking on their behalf to the outside community at large. I’m also a part of an institute which has a great supporting team of engineers to work in computer vision, NLP and allied areas, giving an opportunity for collaborations outside Humanities department.

### Estelle Guéville

#### Bio

Estelle is a French curator and researcher currently pursuing her PhD in Medieval Studies at Yale. She previously worked for cultural institutions in France and the Gulf, including the Louvre Abu Dhabi where she developed digital research. She participates in several DH projects and is the co-creator of the Paris Bible Project, a digital humanities initiative studying abbreviations and special letter forms as markers of scribal practices. In her dissertation, she aims to recover the history of medieval female scribes, using both traditional and digital methods of history and art history. At Yale, she co-created the Graduate Digital Humanities Colloquium, a working group bringing together graduate students across disciplines to explore how digital tools can offer new possibilities in humanistic inquiry.

#### Statement

If elected to the ACH Executive Council, I am committed to helping build a strong community, which includes graduate students as well as practitioners from the GLAM sector working with digital and computational methods. I will actively participate in the organization of existing initiatives, such as the ACH’s conference while developing innovative ideas to support the academic and professional development of graduate students. Active mentoring, networking and technical training are some of the main topics I wish to focus on if I am elected. Using my experience in both cultural institutions and academic environments, I can help bridge the gap between academic and non-academic communities by implementing initiatives bringing together Digital Humanities and Public Humanities. I also wish to promote a supportive, creative, and sustainable environment where everyone can thrive and develop new projects. My international experience helped me build proficiency in project management, leadership, communication and education, an expertise I wish to make available to the ACH community to support its multiple projects and their development.

### Lauren Klein

#### Bio

Lauren Klein is Winship Distinguished Research Professor and Associate Professor in the departments of Quantitative Theory &amp; Methods and English at Emory University, where she also directs the Digital Humanities Lab.

With Matthew K. Gold, she edits *Debates in the Digital Humanities*, a hybrid print-digital publication stream that explores debates in the field as they emerge.

#### Statement

It’s an honor to be nominated to run for membership in the ACH Executive Council, since ACH is so clearly charting a capacious and inclusive vision for the future of the field. If elected, I would look to bring my 15+ years of experience in DH to ACH, along with a continued commitment to listen and learn from emerging DHers. With continued attacks on public higher education, and on the teaching of race and racism in particular, the stakes of our work could not be higher. As a member of the ACH Executive Council, I would look to ally ACH with other scholarly organizations that are mobilizing against these attacks, while supporting ACH initiatives that model how a commitment to public and antiracist scholarship, to diversity of all forms, and to collaboration and labor equity, might open up alternate paths for the future.

### Carrie Johnston

#### Bio

Carrie Johnston is the Digital Humanities Research Designer at Wake Forest University’s Z. Smith Reynolds Library, where she collaborates with researchers across disciplines to develop scholarly digital projects through humanistic inquiry. Her research and teaching consider the ways that technology has historically informed women’s literary labor, and her work has appeared in *Amerikastudien / American Studies*, *American Quarterly*, *College Literature and Studies in the Novel*. She holds a PhD in English literature from Southern Methodist University.

#### Statement

Digital humanities provides a starting place for things that are often overlooked or outright suppressed in higher education, including interdisciplinary research, community engagement, and awareness of unfair labor practices both in and outside of the academy. To that end, my entry point into DH is the humanistic inquiry that I believe is required for an equitable, nuanced, and justice-oriented approach to teaching, learning, and working. As a member of the ACH Executive Council, I would apply these values to cultivate a robust and inclusive DH community and to continue the crucial advocacy work of the ACH.

### Jeri E. Wieringa

#### Bio

Jeri Wieringa is a Digital Historian and Assistant Professor in the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Alabama. She is also the Director of the REL Digital Lab, a digital humanities lab supporting research and teaching in the Department of Religious Studies. She focuses on data curation, machine learning, and natural language processing with historical sources. She considers issues of AI ethics and the intersection of historical methods, focused on context and complexity, and the building of large-scale computational models.

#### Statement

As a scholar working at the intersection of computational tools and the historical study of religion, ACH has long been my primary academic home. If elected, I will work on issues of advocacy and infrastructure for supporting digital scholarship in the humanities. Informed by my experiences at the University of Alabama, the George Mason University Libraries, and with submitting a digital dissertation, I approach questions of infrastructure in terms of the multiple layers of support needed for digital scholarship to thrive, from training and development support to publishing outlets and repository systems capable of supporting complex digital artifacts. I would use this opportunity to identify and address obstacles limiting the creation of digital projects, with the view that supporting junior and emerging digital scholars requires increased institutional support for digital scholarship generally. I look forward to joining the ACH Council in supporting the development, publication, and preservation of digital scholarship.

### Amanda Madden

#### Bio

Amanda Madden is Assistant Professor of History and Director of Geospatial History at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media, George Mason University. Her current research focuses on the spatial intersections between violence and the state and her more DH-focused research interests include pedagogy of DH, open scholarship, digital and multimedia publication. Director of the digital humanities minor at GMU, she teaches DH courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels. She is the collaborator on several spatial projects and hopes to create more freely available resources for learning the tools of digital spatial humanities.

#### Statement

Before getting a tenure-track position in the digital humanities, I worked as an adjunct, a postdoc, and a research scientist but often had limited access to resources, including funding, software, tools, and formal training. Due to my unusual career path and reliance on what I was able to cobble together before my current position, I am conscious of the challenges faced by contingent faculty, faculty at under-resourced institutions, graduate students, and undergrads who have limited access to resources. As I become a mentor, I’m committed to ensuring what justice and equity I can and ensuring that the digital humanities doesn’t become another field with high barriers to entry reliant on an exploited class who receive little credit for their contributions. I see ACH as critical to mentorship, fostering partnerships, working for recognition of the marginalized, and keeping the digital humanities sustainable in the long term in ethical ways.

#### Statement

I am fascinated by ADHO and ACH. I am a passionate DHian, wish to contribute some DH efforts to accelerate ACH mission in global south too. I volunteer the ADHO activities and chose ACH membership because I wish to work with valued members to let attain DH activities in all the departments of humanities and social sciences of the country supplementing new areas of thinking. I know its contribution to preserving humanities and any advanced intersectional disciplines. In my forthcoming works are Digital Humanities Teaching (2023 Springer), “Indigenous AI”, and “Digital Female Misprision And Suicidology: A Data Feminist Approach”, “Decolonizing Web Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence in Education”, an effort is made towards save humanities save people, countries, and its allied beings including nature, culture, and global fraternity boycotting racism of any kinds. If elected, I am willing to serve the positions for international collaborative research, publication, editorial, and other outreach academic, and research growth where lesser-known scholars to DH will be newly networked (esp. from India) with ADHO-ACH. Keeping all these thoughts, I initiated plans to develop six new DH courses for undergraduate program, and conducted a Faculty Development Program on Teaching and Curricular Design of Digital Humanities in June 2022 and conducted (as a convener) a short term course on Pedagogy and Text Analysis in Digital Humanities at LPU Punjab, India. I am directing supervision for Capstone project, Dissertation, and doctorate research in DH. My aim is to contribute by building ADHO-ACH global network of all lesser-known DH researchers with funded DH projects, if possible, because we must save human heritage, humans and posthuman beings without distortions of identities. I am thankful ACH for giving me an opportunity to nominate myself. It reflects that ADHO+ACH is working for global social change and fraternity.

#### Statement

As an early-career scholar, I have been heartened by ACH’s success in supporting historically marginalized and underrepresented scholarship. While I am unable to claim a life experience other than one of privilege, ACH has challenged me to reconsider academic opportunities that merely fill a CV line and instead reflect on ways I could contribute to ongoing efforts for inclusion in DH studies. I am proud to work at CBU, a Memphis-based liberal arts university, where principles such as “social justice,” “respect for all persons,” and “inclusive community” are in direct harmony with the fundamental beliefs of the ACH. As a member of the Executive Council, I would take what I have learned thus far at CBU (and in 10+ years teaching in the North Carolina Community College System) to center my efforts on outreach to smaller institutions with both developing DH programs and predominantly underrepresented student populations.

#### Statement

I was introduced to the digital humanities as an area of theory, praxis and pedagogy that is open for interdisciplinary engagement to create impactful work in and out of academia and where I found a community of practitioners from a range of disciplines that welcome human inquiry, practices, methods and tools to ethically produce knowledge necessary for a better world. A lot of these encounters have been possible because of some of the ACH initiatives, such as conferences, travel bursaries, DH interviews, networking and mentorship programs that have been receptive and supportive of my work. As part of the ACH Executive Council, considering my trajectory in public and digital humanities in different parts of the world, primarily in the Global South and with underrepresented communities in the United States, I want to continue the efforts of past and present members that are pushing for an association where new scholars, community members, students find and create communal and collaborative spaces to engage in the production of knowledge across geographical borders beyond academia. Therefore, in this role I commit myself to create, support and promote social justice initiatives that foster non-hierarchical, multilingual, community-based and ethical practices in the use, development and application of humanities and digital technologies at a local and global level. It is my hope to take ACH to communities and with individuals that have much to share for the DH community to learn from.
