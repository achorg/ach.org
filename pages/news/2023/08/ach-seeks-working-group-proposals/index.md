As announced at the ACH 2023 conference, ACH is soliciting working group proposals for the upcoming academic year. Weâ€™ve posted [guidelines for proposals](/activities/working-groups/) here, along with more information about the benefits of forming a working group. Each working group must have co-chairs who are ACH members.

We hope that the ACH working group framework will provide an avenue for institutional recognition for the work that many people in our community are already doing. Working groups will be featured on the ACH website, will have the opportunity to share updates through the newsletter, and will have a dedicated spot on the ACH conference program.

Have questions about working groups? Drop the ACH co-presidents a note at [president@ach.org](mailto:president@ach.org).
