Over the last decade, at roughly the same time that digital humanities methods and tools have appeared in language and literature classrooms and research, universities have made investments in 3D printing and makerspaces. And in a similar way to digital humanities, those working in modern languages might not immediately see how they could use fabrication technologies in their teaching and research.

For its session at the [2018 MLA Convention](https://www.mla.org/Convention/MLA-2018) (4-7 January in New York City), ACH invites proposals that highlight how 3D printing, soft circuits, or other methods of physical fabrication are used to teach languages or literature *or* to conduct linguistic or literary research. Speakers will give brief talks (4-6 minutes, depending on number of participants) that address the praxis of printing and the metaphysics of physicalization. While a discussion of *what you made* and *how you made it* will naturally feature in these talks, it is more important to discuss how the act of making contributed to the understanding of languages and/or literatures. In this way, this session is cousin to the [ACH’s 2014 session at the MLA](/news/2013/03/beyond-the-digital-cfp-for-mla-2014/).

Please send abstracts of 250 words (not including references) to [brian.croxall@brown.edu](mailto:brian.croxall@brown.edu). Abstracts should be received by **5pm EDT / GMT-5 on <del>15 March 2017</del> 25 March 2017**. N.B. All accepted panelists will need to be current MLA members—or have their membership waived—by 7 April 2017.

Since the ACH is an allied organization of the MLA, this session is guaranteed to be accepted for the 2018 MLA.
