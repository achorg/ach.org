Is this your first or second time at the Digital Humanities conference? Are you new to the DH community? Join a small group of newbies and DH old-timers at a local Montreal restaurant and make scholarly connections and new friendships. It’s not only for members of the ACH!

The dinners will happen the evening of **Wednesday, 9 August 2017**, with parties departing after the poster session. For ease of conversation, groups will be limited to six people.

Registration is already open and places are limited! [Sign up online](http://bit.ly/ACHdinner17).

On the sign-up form, we will want you to identify yourself with ‘n’ for newbie (in your first or second year attending DH) or ‘v’ for DH conference veteran (no more than 2 veterans per party, please!). We will also need one veteran leader for each group, to make a reservation and walk the group over to the restaurant; long-term ACH members and other DH conference veterans are heartily encouraged to volunteer!

We look forward to meeting you in Montreal!

Please note: attendees pay for their own costs. The ACH provides the organization and good cheer.
